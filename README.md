# Overdue Analysis

## Project Overview
The **Overdue Analysis** project focuses on analyzing overdue loans to uncover patterns and identify risk factors associated with loan defaults. Using Python and Jupyter Notebook, loan and client data were processed and visualized to assess overdue amounts, late payment trends, and repayment behaviors. The analysis provided actionable insights into factors contributing to overdue amounts and highlighted segments at higher risk. This work emphasizes the importance of data-driven strategies in managing risk and implementing proactive measures to reduce default rates.

## Key Features
- **Overdue Trends Analysis:** Tracks overdue loans over time, categorizing them by late days, loan types, and other relevant criteria.
- **Risk Factor Identification:** Identifies the key factors contributing to overdue amounts and highlights high-risk segments.
- **Customer Segmentation:** Analyzes repayment behaviors to segment customers based on their likelihood to default.
- **Loan Performance Metrics:** Visualizes overdue amounts and repayment patterns, helping institutions monitor their portfolioâ€™s health.

## Tools and Technologies
- **Python**: For data processing and advanced analytics.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: For interactive analysis and clear documentation.
- **Pandas and NumPy**: To manage and analyze data efficiently.
